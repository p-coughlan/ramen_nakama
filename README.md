## Project Overview

**Ramen Nakama** is a full‑stack e‑commerce application built on Django that lets:

- **Customers**:
  - Register an account and manage their profile  
  - Browse today’s ramen menu and merchandise  
  - Place orders for a chosen delivery date  
  - View past orders  
  - Submit, edit, and delete free‑form reviews (pending approval before display)  

- **Administrators (Store Owner)**:
  - Manage products (add, edit, remove, toggle “sold out”)  
  - Publish news items that surface on the homepage (with an archive view)  
  - Enable or disable live ordering and announce upcoming delivery windows  

The app is deployed on **Heroku**, uses **AWS S3** for static/media hosting, and integrates **Stripe** for secure payment processing. Its responsive **Bootstrap**‑powered front end is supplemented with custom CSS for a distinctive look. Ramen Nakama extends Code Institute’s Boutique Ado template with bespoke models and workflows tailored to the demands of a modern ramen delivery service.

## Visual Design

Overview of the visual and UX approach for Ramen Nakama, including layout, branding, typography, and responsiveness.


### Layout & Structure  
- **Grid System:** Built on a 12‑column Bootstrap grid.  
- **Two‑Column Sections:** Key content (e.g. news cards, feature calls) alternate image/text to keep the page dynamic.  
- **Hero Area:** Full‑width background image with gradient overlay ensures readability of the main headline and CTA.


### Colour Palette  
This palette comes straight from the store’s logo. Deeper integration of these colours into the overall site design is tracked under [Essential Future Improvements](#essential-future-improvements).

| Name         | HEX       | Usage                             |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Ramen Blue   | `#1e234d` | Headers, nav links, borders       |
| Ramen Pink   | `#e75b66` | Primary CTAs, buttons, highlights |
| Ramen Yellow | `#fde9d0` | Background overlays, cards        |

<img src="media/readme/primary-palette.jpg" alt="Colour Palette" width="800">


### Typography  
Ramen Nakama uses the Skia CC family (via Adobe Fonts) to reinforce its brand personality:

- **Skia CC Regular (400):**  
  Applied to body copy, form labels, and secondary headings for clear legibility.  
- **Skia CC Bold (700):**  
  Used for primary headlines, buttons (e.g. “Slurp Now”), and key calls‑to‑action to establish hierarchy.

<img src="media/readme/skia-font.jpg" alt="Skia Adobe Font" width="800">


### Imagery & Icons  
- **Photography:** All product shots and site imagery (hero, dishes, merch) were photographed by the developer; only news‑item images come from external sources.  
- **Product Thumbnails:** Consistent aspect ratio and size for visual harmony.  
- **Icons:** Font Awesome for UI elements (search, user, cart) ensures scalability and crispness.

<img src="media/readme/dishes.jpg" alt="Food Thumbnails" width="800">  
<img src="media/hero.jpg" alt="Hero Image" width="800">


### UI Components & Overrides  
- **Buttons:**  
  - Circular “Slurp Now” in Ramen Pink with a Ramen Blue border.  
  - Full‑width on mobile; auto‑width on larger screens with flex layouts.  
- **Cards:**  
  - `.bg-light` and `.card-body` overridden to Ramen Yellow for consistency.  
  - Soft shadows and 2xl rounded corners for a modern look.  
- **Forms:**  
  - Crispy‑Forms with black borders, square corners, and custom placeholder styling.


### Responsive Behavior  
- **Container Width:** Max‑width set to 80% on extra‑large screens (≥1200px).  
- **Header Padding:** Adjusts between desktop and mobile to accommodate fixed elements.  
- **Button & Text Scaling:** Font sizes and padding adjust via media queries to ensure tap‑target accessibility on mobile.

### 404 Page

  A 404 page, also known as an "error page" or "Page Not Found" page, is a web page displayed by a server when a user tries to access a URL that doesn't exist or the server can't find. It essentially indicates that the requested resource (webpage) could not be located. This can happen due to broken links, typos in the URL, or if the page was deleted or moved.

- `stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded`
- `stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed`
- `stripe trigger charge.succeeded`
- `stripe trigger charge.failed`

As the site owner, I want to open/close ordering windows and set announcement messages so that customers know when they can order.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Can toggle an `OrderWindow.active` flag and edit `ordering_message`.  
- Homepage banner and CTAs appear only when active.  
**Fulfilment:**  
- `OrderWindow` model in admin; `ordercontrol.context_processors.order_status` injects current window; templates conditionally render banner and “Slurp Now” button.

---

### 6. Admin – News & Announcements  
**Story:**  
As the site owner, I want to publish news items and archive older ones so that I can keep customers informed.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Can add title, image, and content for news in admin.  
- Latest item shows on homepage; archive paginates in alternating layout.  
**Fulfilment:**  
- `News` model registered; homepage partial queries latest item; `NewsArchiveView` with pagination and `news_archive.html` flex layout alternating image/text.

---

### 7. Admin – Review Moderation  
**Story:**  
As the site owner, I want to approve or reject reviews so that only appropriate feedback appears.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Admin can toggle `Review.approved`.  
- Only approved reviews appear in the homepage ticker.  
**Fulfilment:**  
- `Review` model in admin list with approval toggle; `approved_reviews` context processor filters for homepage; jQuery cycle shows approved reviews only.

---

### 8. Cross‑Cutting – Responsiveness & Accessibility  
**Story:**  
As any user, I want the site to adapt across devices and support keyboard navigation and sufficient color contrast.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Layout reflows at Bootstrap breakpoints; icons and text scale for mobile.  
- All interactive elements accessible via keyboard; color contrast meets WCAG AA.  
**Fulfilment:**  
- Bootstrap grid with custom media queries; mobile nav flex-nowrap; semantic HTML with focus styles; contrast ratios verified with WebAIM tools.

## Design Considerations

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  Ramen Nakama is split into focused Django “apps” (e.g. products, checkout, reviews, news, ordercontrol, profiles). This separation of concerns makes it easy to extend features—like adding a wishlist or ratings—without bloating unrelated code. Shared logic (context processors, custom storage backends) keeps templates and views DRY and maintainable.
  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Built on Bootstrap 4’s 12-column grid, every page—from the home news ticker to the two-column archive—flows seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and phone. Custom media queries fine-tune header padding, button sizing, and text scales to ensure tap-targets remain accessible and legible on small screens.

- **Streamlined User Experience:**  
  Customers can place an order in just a few clicks: browse (or search) → add to bag → choose delivery window → Stripe checkout → confirmation. Reviews submit via a crisp Crispy-Forms layout, immediately redirecting to a “Thank You” page. Admins manage content and feedback from a unified Django Admin interface, with clear approval flows and live status banners.

- **Robust Deployment & Maintenance:**  
  Code is versioned in GitHub and deployed via Heroku. All static assets and media uploads are stored on AWS S3—served directly from the S3 bucket in production, and from the local static/ directory in development. Environment variables manage sensitive keys (Django secret, AWS credentials, Stripe keys), ensuring a secure, repeatable deploy process.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This diagram illustrates the relationships between our core data models:

- **UserProfile** extends Django’s built-in User and can have multiple **Order**s.  
- Each **Order** comprises one or more **OrderLineItem**s, which reference individual **Product**s.  
- **Product**s are grouped by **Category** for easy filtering and display.  
- Stand-alone models **News** and **OrderWindow** power the homepage announcements and ordering window logic.  
- **Review** entries link back to the User who submitted them, appearing in both the profile and the homepage ticker once approved.

### Under the Hood – Django’s Built-in Models

In addition to our six custom apps, the “Full ERD” includes Django’s core tables that power authentication, permissions, admin, and sessions:

- **auth_user**  
  The primary user table holding credentials, email, and basic profile info.

- **auth_group** & **auth_permission**  
  Define named role groups and granular permissions; users can belong to any number of groups, each granting a set of permissions.

- **django_content_type**  
  Tracks all installed models (by app and model name) so that permissions and generic relations can reference them dynamically.

- **django_session**  
  Persists logged-in sessions, enabling “remember me” and cross-request authentication.

- **admin_log**  
  Records all CRUD actions taken in the Django admin interface, linking back to both the actor (auth_user) and the affected content type.

By layering our **UserProfile**, **Order**, **Product**, **News**, **OrderWindow**, and **Review** models on top of Django’s builtin tables, we reuse battle-tested authentication and permission logic while keeping our business-specific data neatly separated.  

<img src="grouped_erd.png" alt="ERD diagram" width="800">

## Data Models

### 1. UserProfile (`profiles/models.py`)
- **Extends** Django’s built-in `User` via a one-to-one link.  
- Stores default delivery info (phone, street, city, country, etc.).  
- A `post_save(User)` signal automatically creates or updates the profile on registration.  
- **Relation:** `Order.user_profile` → lets you fetch a customer’s past orders via `user_profile.orders.all()`.

---

### 2. Category & Product (`products/models.py`)
- **Category**  
  - Lookup table for product groupings (e.g. “Meat Ramen,” “Sides,” “Merchandise”).  
- **Product**  
  - ForeignKey → `Category`  
  - Fields: `sku`, `name`, `description`, `price`, optional `rating`, image(s), and `sold_out` flag.  
- **Relation:** `OrderLineItem.product` → ties each line-item back to its `Product`.

---

### 3. Order & OrderLineItem (`checkout/models.py`)
- **Order**  
  - UUID-based `order_number` generated on save.  
  - Captures buyer details, timestamp, Stripe payment ID, and raw bag JSON.  
  - Methods to compute `order_total`, conditional delivery fees, and `grand_total`.  
  - **Relation:** FK → `UserProfile` (nullable), `related_name='orders'`.  
- **OrderLineItem**  
  - FK → `Order` (`related_name='lineitems'`) and FK → `Product`.  
  - Auto-calculates `lineitem_total = product.price × quantity` in `save()`.  
  - **Relation:** Enables `order.lineitems.aggregate(Sum('lineitem_total'))`.

---

### 4. News (`news/models.py`)
- Fields: `title`, `content`, optional `ImageField(upload_to='news/')`, `published_date` (default `now`), and `featured` flag.  
- Meta: `ordering = ['-published_date']` for newest-first.  
- **Relation:** No foreign keys—used in homepage “latest news” and paginated archive.

---

### 5. OrderWindow (`ordercontrol/models.py`)
- Controls live ordering windows:  
  - `is_open` boolean + `next_delivery_date`.  
  - `is_ordering_active` property returns `True` only if ordering is open and now is more than 48 hours before `next_delivery_date`.  
  - `ordering_message` property generates context-aware banners (“Place your order for…”, “Ordering is closed…”).  
- **Relation:** Exposed via a context processor to every template to toggle banners and CTAs.

---

### 6. Review (`reviews/models.py`)
- FK → Django `User`, `review_text`, `created_at`, `approved` flag.  
- Workflow:  
  1. User submits → saved with `approved=False`.  
  2. Admin toggles `approved=True` in Django admin.  
  3. Approved reviews injected into the homepage ticker via context processor.  
- **Relation:** Linked to `User`, shown in both profile and homepage ticker.

---

### Overall Relationships
1. **Users** → one-to-one → **UserProfile**  
2. **UserProfile** → one-to-many → **Order**  
3. **Order** → one-to-many → **OrderLineItem** → many-to-one → **Product**  
4. **Product** → many belongs to → **Category**  
5. **News** and **OrderWindow** are standalone models powering site content and ordering logic.  
6. **Review** → FK → **User**, displaying approved feedback site-wide.

This modular structure leverages Django’s auth system, cleanly separates concerns, and remains readily extensible (e.g. attaching reviews to products or adding a Wishlist model in the future).

## Essential Future Improvements

- **Order Window Optimistaion:**  
  Create a custom interface outside of the Django admin panel that the superuser can use to create, edit and delete order window information.
  At present the store is marked as 'open for orders' at time of creating the order window and delivery slot with no option for modifying existing windows.

- **Custom access to Django admin:**  
  At present, the Django admin panel is only accesible by adding `/admin` to the address. For example: 'https://milestone-four-ff783f75758e.herokuapp.com/admin'
  Create a visible link in the 'staff approved' dropdown menu.

- **Custom News Management:**  
  At present, the News management is accessible via the Django admin panel - create a custom feature for the superuser to **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** news items. This will be styled in-line with the Product Management section.

- **Correct Time in Django Admin:**  
  Django admin is currently notifying the user that we are 1 hour ahead of server time - correct this.
  
- **Mobile Optimization:**  
  Further refine mobile UX.
  
- **User Account Features:**  
  Implement wishlists and order tracking.

---

## Other Future Improvements

- **Integrate Instagram Feed:**

  - **Goal:** Display the store owner’s latest Instagram photos on the site to boost social engagement and keep content fresh.  
    - **Approach:**  
    - **Embed Widget:** Use Instagram’s official embed code for a simple “Follow us” gallery.  
    - **API Fetch:** Periodically pull recent posts via Instagram’s API and show them as thumbnails.  
  - **UX Notes:**  
    - Make it responsive so images rearrange neatly on mobile.  
    - Include a clear “Follow on Instagram” link beneath the feed.  


- **New Content Types:**  
  Ideas for Mailing List integration and additional user feedback models.
  
- **Real-time Updates:**  
  Consider WebSockets or AJAX for live order tracking and notifications.

## Troubleshooting Highlights

1. **Invalid `{% break %}` Tag**  
   - **Problem:** Templates threw `Invalid block tag: 'break'`.  
   - **Diagnosis:** Error log showed Django doesn’t support `{% break %}` in loops.  
   - **Fix:** Replace the loop+break with the slice filter:  
     ```django
     {% for item in news|slice:":1" %} … {% endfor %}
     ```

2. **Missing `news_detail.html` Template**  
   - **Problem:** `TemplateDoesNotExist: news_detail.html`.  
   - **Diagnosis:** Template‑loader postmortem showed Django looked in `templates/` and `templates/news/`.  
   - **Fix:** Either move `news_detail.html` into `templates/` or update the view to  
     ```python
     template_name = 'news/news_detail.html'
     ```

3. **NoReverseMatch: ‘news-detail’ Not Found**  
   - **Problem:** Clicking “Read More” raised `Reverse for 'news-detail' not found`.  
   - **Diagnosis:** The URL pattern for the detail view wasn’t defined.  
   - **Fix:** In `news/urls.py`, add  
     ```python
     path('<int:pk>/', NewsDetailView.as_view(), name='news-detail')
     ```

4. **News Detail Image Hidden Under Header**  
   - **Problem:** Top of the news image was cropped by the fixed banner.  
   - **Diagnosis:** Manual resize and inspection showed content starting too high.  
   - **Fix:** Add top padding to the container (via CSS or Bootstrap utilities), e.g.:  
     ```css
     .main-content { padding-top: 150px; }
     ```
     or in template:  
     ```html
     <div class="container pt-5">…</div>
     ```

5. **`review_success.html` Not Found**  
   - **Problem:** `TemplateDoesNotExist: review_success.html` for the success view.  
   - **Diagnosis:** Postmortem paths showed Django only looked in `…/reviews/templates/reviews/`.  
   - **Fix:** Move the file to  
     ```
     reviews/templates/reviews/review_success.html
     ```  
     and render with  
     ```python
     return render(request, 'reviews/review_success.html')
     ```

6. **NoReverseMatch: ‘submit_review’ Not Found**  
   - **Problem:** Redirect or `{% url 'submit_review' %}` failed.  
   - **Diagnosis:** URL pattern was named differently (e.g. `submit-review`).  
   - **Fix:** In `reviews/urls.py`, rename the pattern to match:  
     ```python
     path('submit/', submit_review, name='submit_review')
     ```

7. **NoReverseMatch: ‘review-success’ vs ‘review_success’**  
   - **Problem:** Redirect to `'review-success'` failed after form submit.  
   - **Diagnosis:** View used `redirect('review_success')` but URL was named `review-success`.  
   - **Fix:** Use a single convention (underscores) everywhere:  
     ```python
     path('review-success/', review_success, name='review_success')
     ```

8. **User Reviews Missing on Profile**  
   - **Problem:** Approved reviews didn’t show under “My Reviews.”  
   - **Diagnosis:** Profile view context didn’t include `reviews`.  
   - **Fix:** Import and add to context in `profiles/views.py`:  
     ```python
     from reviews.models import Review
     reviews = Review.objects.filter(user=request.user)
     context['reviews'] = reviews
     ```

9. **Inconsistent Button Stacking**  
   - **Problem:** Edit/Delete buttons sometimes stacked unevenly on medium screens.  
   - **Diagnosis:** Manual testing showed default inline/stack mix at breakpoints.  
   - **Fix:** Wrap buttons with flex classes:  
     ```html
     <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row">
       <a class="btn w-100 w-md-auto mb-2 mb-md-0 mr-md-2">Edit</a>
       <a class="btn w-100 w-md-auto">Delete</a>
     </div>
     ```

10. **Date Not Displayed (‘submitted on’ Blank)**  
    - **Problem:** Template showed “Submitted on” but no date.  
    - **Diagnosis:** Model uses `created_at`, but template referenced `created_date`.  
    - **Fix:** Update the template to use the correct field:  
      ```django
      Submitted on {{ review.created_at|date:"F j, Y" }}
      ```

11. **Missing Ordering Banner When No OrderWindow Exists**  
    - **Problem:** The “order-banner” div renders nothing if there is no `OrderWindow` record.  
    - **Diagnosis:** `OrderWindow.objects.first()` returns `None`, so the `{% if order_window %}` block never displays.  
    - **Fix:** Add an `else` clause in template to show a default message when `order_window` is `None`:
      ```django
      {% if order_window %}
        <div class="order-banner">
          {{ order_window.ordering_message }}
        </div>
      {% else %}
        <div class="order-banner">
          Ordering is currently closed.
        </div>
      {% endif %}
      ```

12. **Context Processor Doesn’t Supply a Default Window**  
    - **Problem:** Having to handle `None` in every template is repetitive and error-prone.  
    - **Diagnosis:** The `order_status` context processor passes `None` when there are no `OrderWindow` records, so downstream templates must check for it.  
    - **Fix:** Update the context processor so it always provides an object with an `ordering_message`:
      ```python
      # ordercontrol/context_processors.py
      from .models import OrderWindow
      from types import SimpleNamespace

      def order_status(request):
          window = OrderWindow.objects.first()
          if not window:
              # Provide a dummy object with the same API
              window = SimpleNamespace(ordering_message="Ordering is currently closed.")
          return {'order_window': window}
      ```

13. **Stale “Next Delivery” Message After the Date Has Passed**  
    - **Problem:** Once the `next_delivery_date` passes, `ordering_message` still falls into the `elif self.next_delivery_date` branch and displays the old date.  
    - **Diagnosis:** The `ordering_message` property only checks `is_ordering_active` and then “does the date exist?”, without verifying that the date is still in the future.  
    - **Fix:** Update `ordering_message` to first check whether `next_delivery_date` is already past, e.g.:
      ```python
      @property
      def ordering_message(self):
          today = timezone.now().date()
          if self.next_delivery_date and today > self.next_delivery_date:
              return "Ordering is now closed."
          if self.is_ordering_active:
              return (
                  f"Place your order now for delivery on "
                  f"{self.next_delivery_date:%B %d, %Y}. Order processing closes 48 hours before."
              )
          if self.next_delivery_date:
              return (
                  "Ordering is currently closed. "
                  f"Next delivery is scheduled for {self.next_delivery_date:%B %d, %Y}."
              )
          return "Ordering is currently closed."
      ```

14. **Reviews stacking and disappearing after tab focus change**  
    - **Problem:** When returning to the tab after a pause, multiple fade animations queue up, causing reviews to stack and then vanish one by one.  
    - **Diagnosis:** jQuery’s `.fadeIn()`/`.fadeOut()` calls were being queued during the hidden/visible state changes, so on resume all pending animations ran in quick succession.  
    - **Fix:** Clear any queued animations before each fade and reset visibility on resume. In your `postloadjs` block, update the ticker script to:

    ```javascript
    function showNextReview() {
      // Stop and clear any queued animations on all items
      items.stop(true, true);
      items.eq(current).fadeOut(1000, function() {
        current = (current + 1) % items.length;
        items.eq(current).fadeIn(1000);
      });
    }

    document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', function() {
      if (document.hidden) {
        clearInterval(tickerInterval);
      } else {
        // Reset all items visibility, ensure only the current is shown
        items.hide().eq(current).show();
        tickerInterval = setInterval(showNextReview, 5000);
      }
    });
    ```
